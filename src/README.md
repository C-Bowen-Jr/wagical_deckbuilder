# Wagical Deckbuilder

## Description
Wagical Deckbuilder is a version 2.0 rewrite from the ground up of an earlier [project](https://github.com/C-Bowen-Jr/wagic_deck_builder). There is a trade off of complexity to compile, run, or modify between these 
two versions. However, the improved graphical aspect of the 2.0+ version should be considered worth it for 
those who care about the card art. This tool can also be utilized as a local deck list notation/archival 
tool.

## Features
- Improved search result
- Card spoilers

## Installation

Currently at an early stage of development

## Usage

Card search functions based on scryfall. Clicking a card name bar adds 1 of that card to the decklist. 
Still early development, no other features.
